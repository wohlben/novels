        "remote_id": "288780",
        "content": "\nLady Shyora smiled at me as a pair of succubi wearing a tabard displaying Malcanthet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s symbol (and little else) came into the arena and gathered up the now-defiled daughter of Pelor. Not bothering to give the godling another look, I turned to face the Lilitu. She held up her arms to silence the crowd, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell done, well done, Lord Darkmore! The Queen of Pleasures is pleased with all you have done here this day! As promised, you and yours shall join the others who have earned the right to visit the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Retreat in Shudderwall, but while they shall know pleasures and more at the hands of some of the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devoted servants, you shall enjoy the company of Malcanthet herself for the week you reside within her halls, an honor granted to very few mortals indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs she spoke, five large flying creatures were brought into the arena, along with the other competitors who had earned the trip, and their attendants, which included my party, of course. Looking at the massive creatures, they appeared to be some kind of demonic manta ray, and yet they clearly could fly with ease through the air. Each creature was the size of an elder dragon and carried a platform with seats upon its back. The platforms and the harnesses for the demon beasts were all lavishly done in crimson and polished steel, and bearing the symbol of Malcanthet upon the forehead of each beast, and upon the back of each chair on the platforms.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShyora led me to the central of the five creatures, and I climbed up with my pets. The other contestants and their servants split themselves between the other creatures. Looking over to Shyora, I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never heard of creatures such as these.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShyora laughed, and it was a beautiful laugh. One could get lost in the sound of her laughter, if they did not know who and what she was. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, this is a Flauvaaxu. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not surprised you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen or heard of them before. They may look impressive, but they are fairly docile creatures, enjoying the winds over the mountains near Shudderwall. Something about Shendilavri sustaines them in a way that no other plane can. They are gentle creatures, and useful for transporting people to the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Retreat without going through the Labryinth or risking the dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ire, but they are ill suited to life outside this realm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI nodded slowly as we rose from the ground with great flaps of the beasts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098wings\u00e2\u0080\u0099. I noticed a tinge of magic in the air as we flew, showing that a shield of air covered the platform we rode on, allowing us to breathe and talk easily enough, even though we were soon speeding along quite fast through the skies of Shendilavri. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, I see. And the magic to protect the platforms is well done. Subtle, especially if one didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to look for. But then, I expect no less from what must be the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carriage, for lack of a better word, when she wishes to transport herself about the layer without the effort of spellwork?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShyora smiled, and nodded to me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, yes, when the Queen wishes to be seen, or to convey guests personally to her palace in Rivenheart or the retreat of Shudderwall, the Flauvaaxu are sent out so that her guests may relax and observe the beauty of her lands in comfort as they fly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd flying very fast they are, too. It is hard to tell from the waves below, but looking back, the island is quite a ways behind us already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, Istancion was already fading into the distance as we flew across the Scarlet Sea, heading into the west. It was receeding at such a pace that I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised if we were outracing many cars on the highways of the real world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShyora giggled, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the route we will fly is almost three hundred miles long, but we will be there in just shy of three hours. Tell me, Lord Darkmore, Chosen of Sharess, do you have any idea of what we might do in those hours while we are flying above the lands of lust and pleasure?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI smiled at her, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Lady Shyora, Radiant Sister of Malcanthet, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you sit upon my lap and I will tell you of what I might find an interesting diversion as we fly through the skies, hmm?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHah! I told you he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI ignored the chattering behind me, and the sound of money exchanging hands as bets were won and lost while Shyora climbed into my chair, and we began a long discussion on the proper way of traveling in Shendilavri.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTwo hours later, I was quite relaxed, as was Shyora. Oh, we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone at it the whole time, but a nice, leisurely ride while riding in the sky was quite enjoyable, and left me quite relaxed, as I said, when we passed over Rivenheart, and then turned to the north, passing over a great hedge maze covering at least a hundred miles. At one point as we flew over, I saw a dragon in the sky below, circling the maze and looking down for prey.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShyora leaned over from her chair, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about Gulmengluum. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really a wonderful conversationalist, when you find something to interest him. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken it upon himself to be the guardian of the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maze, ensuring that no one cheats by trying to fly or simply blast their way through the hedges or going in as a group. It is said that if someone makes it to the true center, then the Queen will grant them one Wish. Such a boon is not given lightly, and so Gulmengluum ensures that any who seek it do so fairly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI spent the next hour considering the enormous hedge maze. This was the Abyss, so it was likely that things were not so simple as just \u00e2\u0080\u0098get to the center of the maze\u00e2\u0080\u0099. No, there were likely to be all kinds of traps down there, and monsters as well. And going in alone, while being unable to fly out or cheat? That was an excellent way to find yourself trapped forever within the maze, until you eventually perished. It was, perhaps, a good metaphor for this plane in general. The beauty that was everywhere and the pleasures offered in every corner were merely an enticement, a trap, designed to lure people into shifting their allegiances and giving themselves over to the Demon Queen of the Succubi.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSoon, the mountains in the distance began to come into more detail, with snow-topped peaks that looked no different than those in any part of the material plane, but likely had all sorts of interesting encounters for those who thought mountain climbing was a fun diversion. Upon the slopes of one such mountain, the monotony of grey stone and white snow was broken by the peach-colored stone walls that rose out of the cliffs on a high shelf. High towers and long halls marked the areas within the keep. It looked like a medieval castle, and more like the Neuschwanstein Castle, yet every curve and line seemed sensual in some way, especially the twin towers with their luscious domes, conveying a feeling of warmth, welcome, and lust that went beyond simple architecture. The building was designed and enchanted to make those who saw it long to be there, to be inside its walls.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe other four flauvaaxu lande upon a shelf clearly designed for the purpose, just outside the great gate on the outer wall that separated the palace, for that is what it was, from the outside world. That gate, an upright oval of a darker pink than the surrounding stone, stood open, a rose quartz nearly three feet across (and thus perfectly proportioned for its placement at the top of the arch) glowing brightly as pink light played over those who entered, in what Shyora told me was a magical scan for ill intent against Malcanthet, but I did not doubt was more than just that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstead of the landing outside the gates of Shudderwall like the others, we flew low over the keep, passing through the valley between the two towers until we came to a landing at a tall building in the back, where crimson rested against the peach stone, forming a pair of luscious lips when viewed from afar. Above them were two great rounded windows, like eyes, and the black tiled roof looking ever so much like raven hair falling against the mountainside. On a landing by the \u00e2\u0080\u0098lips\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the great flying creature came to a rest, and Shyora led us off the platform, so that the flauvaaxu could return to wherever they stayed when they were not waiting upon the Succubus Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whim to carry passengers to and from her lair. As we dismounted, another beauty emerged from a doorway inset in the peach colored walls.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShyora spoke quickly with the woman, and then turned to us. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid that I must leave now, as there are things which must be attended to back in Rivenheart, and the Queen has trusted me to handle them. This is Ifrana Shadowmane, the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal maid, and the one who truly runs things here in Shudderwall. She will take you to where the Queen is awaiting your presence and pleasure. I hope you will come and see me when you next pass through Rivenheart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And with a wink, she teleported away in a flash, leaving us with the new woman.\n\n\u00a0\n<td width=\"367\">Ifrana ShadowmaneGodtouched Half-Dragon Succubus FemaleLevel 200 Chaos Sorceress (Flame Sorceress) / Chaos Fist (Monk)Titles: Magick Seeker, Genius, Polyglot, Dark Ritualist, Divine Ritualist, Drunken Fist Initiate, Serpent Style Initiate, Midnight Aesthetician, Sadist, Masochist, Sexecutioner, Chief Maid of Shudderwall</td>\n\nGodtouched Half-Dragon Succubus Female\n\nTitles: Magick Seeker, Genius, Polyglot, Dark Ritualist, Divine Ritualist, Drunken Fist Initiate, Serpent Style Initiate, Midnight Aesthetician, Sadist, Masochist, Sexecutioner, Chief Maid of Shudderwall\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs the maid looked us over, I took a moment to observe her. She had quite the impressive collection of titles, and a couple advanced classes I had not heard of before. Perhaps they were demon-exclusives? At any rate, it was clear that whoever had chosen the \u00e2\u0080\u0098uniform\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for the chief maid had a very lustful eye, and knew best how to emphasize her assets. Picture the sluttiest \u00e2\u0080\u0098French maid\u00e2\u0080\u0099 costume you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, and then remove 10% more fabric from it. And yet I could see from the aura that the clothes were not mere fabric, but actually provided some serious protection, as good as any high-level cloth armor would have a right to expect. It was carefully tailored to hide what needed to be hidden, though keeping it always on the edge of accessibility, while offering her freedom of movement and the magical protection enhancing her defensese more than a suit of plate armor might. Even the feather duster she carried in one hand was heavily enchanted, to the point I did not doubt that it was more than just a simple duster.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen she spoke, it was not in a way that would convey \u00e2\u0080\u0098lust\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098sexy maid available for your pleasure\u00e2\u0080\u0099, but more the cool, ice queen of the library kind of tone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWelcome, honored guests, to Shudderwall. The Gates will close momentarily, and will remain magically sealed for seven days once they have been shut unless the Queen herself commands them to open. While you are here, all manner of pleasures will be available to you. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. However, you are not allowed to interfere with the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servants who are performing her will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She pointed out a silk band on her right arm that had the symbol of\u00a0Malcanthet upon it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny servant wearing a band with the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s symbol on it like this one is on the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, and is not to be touched until they have completed their task and taken off the band. At any other point, day or night, anywhere within the palace, anyone you see here is free for use by anyone, save those who are slaves, and then they must abide by their Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will. Attempting to use a slave belonging to another against their Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will shall be considered a grave offense. The last fool to test these rules was thrown naked through a portal to Thanatos, the plane ruled by Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead, for the roaving bands of the undead to devour.

brain, using it like an organic computer. Age of Anarchy Online (AAO) is the newest game released by Icestorm, makers of the legendary World of Destiny (WoD). Unlike VR games before it, AAO promises a 110% \\'Better Than Life\\' realism experience, and to showcase this, Icestorm announces that AAO will have no \\'Out of Character\\' rules, save for actions like hacking or exploiting system errors. Players can do anything to NPCs and even other players, and there will be no consequences save what one may suffer in game. \"Do what thou wilt, but it may be done to you in turn.\" Mike Greene, better known in WoD as Torgan, a max level Paladin and leader of the Lords of Light, one of the top \\'light side\\' guilds in WoD, now sets off on a new adventure in AAO. -------------------- Author\\'s Note: If you haven\\'t guessed, and the mature tag didn\\'t help clue you in, there\\'s going to be all kinds of nastiness in this story. Violence, language, racism, sexism, sex, gore, vore, and more! If you have triggers of any kind, this is your warning. If you\\'re looking for a nice, heartwarming tale like Sword Art Online, keep looking. There will be \\'good guys\\' as well, but this is a story where Might IS Right. However, if you\\'ve read Watchmen and Wanted, and like what you read (READ, not the movies!), then you just may find this story in your strike zone. And for f*ck\\'s sake, this is just a story! Don\\'t take this as an endorsement of any of the actions in this story.</p>\\r\\n                                </div>\\r\\n                                <label for=\"showMore\" class=\"bold

<p>First of all, for those that keep saying stuff like \"this is so kinky, yadayada I\\'ll give this a negative review cause I couldn\\'t handle all the copulate-related scenes\" I want to say this: \"Clearly you didn\\'t read the entire description the author has given this story, because there they already wrote that this story has sex-infested scenes, and even have the warning that this story&nbsp;fiction contains:</p>\\r\\n<ul class=\"list-inline\">\\r\\n<li>Profanity</li>\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n<li>Sexual Content</li>\\r\\n<li>Traumatising content</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>so I really do not understand why some of you seem to be whining about it being like this. I understand that this is not everyone\\'s favorite type of story, and that\\'s completely understandable, but to hate it because it uses, in the author\\'s own words, \\'sexy-time to build the story\\', is a bit insulting the author that already warned you that sexy-time will be present in the story. Honestly I admire how nonchalant the author has been about that type of hate, because they could of just as well stopped writing all together because an overload of negative crittisism can really damage an author\\'s will to continue writing, so I applaud you author, your determination is outstanding.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The second thing I want to say to the author is that I really don\\'t mind that some sexy-time is patreon-only, as long as it trully does not disrupt the storyline itself. I get enough sexy-time from what you use to build the story, so if you want to earn some cash from those good extra scenes is fine by me :3</p>\\r\\n<p>So on to the ratings!</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Style: I see you have developed your own style of writing that really compliments the flow of the story, so I have no complaints here.</li>\\r\\n<li>Story: It is indeed an awesome story, but in the latter chapters I really got overwhelmed by all the things the mc has to go do. That in itself is actually a positive sign that your character can still do many things to keep the story running, but it kept this \\'need to do this, then do that\\'-string of events that it came over as overwhelming. I would suggest there being chapters of True down-time for the mc; where his to-do list should be out of sight (for atleast a moment). For the rest the author balances the times of action and the times of rest pretty well, so the rest is also good in my book.</li>\\r\\n<li>Grammar: I am really amazed by how good the grammar is, it\\'s so good that even honest dislikers of the story have rated it pretty well. It even came to that I find it an accomplishment if I found even one letter out of place, and I have only had one or two accomplishments in finding such errors (there was this once that a hir/shi character has been accidentally called a she, but even that could have been auto-correct thinking it was correct).</li>\\r\\n<li>Characters: the characters we have been interacting with have all been pretty 3-d to me, and all have a reason for doing what they are doing, some having a pretty interesting backstory which leaded them to be in the mc\\'s \\'party\\'. The only one that puts me a bit off is the hir/shi character, being a bit of a fan-made character (which shi partly is). I feel the mc doesn\\'t look eye-to-eye to this character, but that can also just be me.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>This has been my opinion and my review, you don\\'t have to agree, but I hope it proves justice to how good the story is :3</p>\\r\\n<p>Have a nice day~</p>\\r\\n<p>- Elina Violets</p>\\r\\n                                            </div>\\r\\n                                            <label for=\"rv-164643\" class=\"small bold uppercase\"></label>\\r\\n                                        <!--START REVIEW FOOTER-->\\r\\n                                        <div class=\"review-footer\">\\r\\n                                            <div class=\"btn-group btn-group-solid margin-bottom-10\">\\r\\n                                                <a href=\"/report/review/164643\" class=\"btn red\">\\r\\n                                                    <i class=\"fa fa-warning\"></i>\\r\\n                                                    Report\\r\\n                                                </a>\\r\\n                                            </div>\\r\\n                                            <div class=\"btn-group btn-group-solid pull-right\" style=\"float: right !important;\">\\r\\n<form action=\"/fictions/ratereview/164643\" class=\"inline-block\" method=\"post\">                                                    <button class=\"btn blue-dark\" name=\"up\" value=\"true\">\\r\\n                                                        <i class=\"fa fa-thumbs-up\"></i> 35\\r\\n                                                    </button>\\r\\n                                                    <button class=\"btn red-sunglo\" name=\"up\" value=\"false\">\\r\\n                                                        <i class=\"fa fa-thumbs-down\"></i> 9\\r\\n                                                    </button>\\r\\n<input name=\"__RequestVerificationToken\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"CfDJ8PgSJZb9k0RMmqo2aF0lNT6K4h-Pd0WaX1ZdiQvOViy0WftmpLAD1-RRKJBXmeMwrLesXO-rnrbLPs7NEJe402C2feTxTAbyzrTxx793og94kBDMbUjlkvgNMxGydi3a21v4SQ6Il7F3Bt2gnGMpzMg\" /></form>                                            </div>\\r\\n                                        </div><!--END REVIEW FOOTER-->\\r\\n                                    </div><!--END REVIEW RIGHT CONTENT-->\\r\\n                                </div><!--END REVIEW ITEM-->\\r\\n                                <!-- START REVIEW ITEM-->\\r\\n                                <div class=\"row review\">\\r\\n                                    <!--START REVIEW LEFT CONTENT-->\\r\\n                                    <div class=\"col-sm-2 review-side\">\\r\\n                                        <div class=\"text-center margin-bottom-20\">\\r\\n                                            <img src=\"https://www.royalroadcdn.com/spiderqueen/1545c7e0-e900-4365-8962-b5cad7734849.png\" data-type=\"avatar\" onLoad=\"$(this).data(\\'loaded\\', 1)\" onError=\"this.onerror=null;

The main character can do no wrong and every action they take works out perfectly.</p>\\r\\n<p>I enjoy the setting (even if much of it is stolen from Forgotten Realms/WotC which you should probably beware of if you\\'re attempting monetization) and the system created for the in-game MMO is interesting. The characters are horrendous, but perhaps a by-product of too many being present and attention can\\'t be paid to any of them to a great degree. Regardless, when they are given attention they\\'re pretty much just extensions of the main character with little thought or will to themselves, even the side characters that aren\\'t NPCs but other players. There are few female characters written with any degree of strength, poise, or strong characterization but to be fair there aren\\'t any male characters beyond the MC written with any depth at all.</p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>It\\'s well-written with good grammar, and while there does appear to be a plot in the development it\\'s a bit mired in lewd scenes that lack any significant detail to really be called erotic. They\\'re a touch too frequent and too little detailed to be of great interest. It could do with a bit more imagery, which is probably where it\\'s most lacking in terms of technical skills. Areas aren\\'t really described, and neither are people which should be one of the greatest strengths in the fantasy genre.</p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>P.S. In that scene where he had to keep the two weak NPCs alive in the dungeon, could he not have just put them in that extradimensional tent he has? It doesn\\'t really matter as it was a foregone conclusion that he wouldn\\'t fail at anything.</p>\\r\\n<p>P.P.S. One of my questions is: what occurs in game while the player is not in game? Does their avatar fade out or is it locked in game asleep ready to be ganked? How does the time dilation factor into that? If they go outside the game to sleep/eat (as they must surely do) days/weeks might seem to pass in game. The only way to account for that at the moment is that perhaps years can pass in game before needing to go out of game (though that in itself could lead to some power level discrepancies like if Zayn logged out his enemies would have years to work against him).</p>\\r\\n<p>P.P.P.S. Please be consistent in the pronouns used for Hrozne. In one chapter you refer to them as \"hir/shi\" in another it\\'ll be \"her/she\" and in yet another it will be \"him/he\". I dislike artifically crafted pronouns such as \"hir/shi\" but at least be consistent.</p>\\r\\n                                            </div>\\r\\n                                            <label for=\"rv-228689\" class=\"small bold uppercase\"></label>\\r\\n                                        <!--START REVIEW FOOTER-->\\r\\n                                        <div class=\"review-footer\">\\r\\n                                            <div class=\"btn-group btn-group-solid margin-bottom-10\">\\r\\n                                                <a href=\"/report/review/228689\" class=\"btn red\">\\r\\n                                                    <i class=\"fa fa-warning\"></i>\\r\\n                                                    Report\\r\\n                                                </a>\\r\\n                                            </div>\\r\\n                                            <div class=\"btn-group btn-group-solid pull-right\" style=\"float: right !important;\">\\r\\n<form action=\"/fictions/ratereview/228689\" class=\"inline-block\" method=\"post\">                                                    <button class=\"btn blue-dark\" name=\"up\" value=\"true\">\\r\\n                                                        <i class=\"fa fa-thumbs-up\"></i> 16\\r\\n                                                    </button>\\r\\n                                                    <button class=\"btn red-sunglo\" name=\"up\" value=\"false\">\\r\\n                                                        <i class=\"fa fa-thumbs-down\"></i> 5\\r\\n                                                    </button>\\r\\n<input name=\"__RequestVerificationToken\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"CfDJ8PgSJZb9k0RMmqo2aF0lNT6K4h-Pd0WaX1ZdiQvOViy0WftmpLAD1-RRKJBXmeMwrLesXO-rnrbLPs7NEJe402C2feTxTAbyzrTxx793og94kBDMbUjlkvgNMxGydi3a21v4SQ6Il7F3Bt2gnGMpzMg\" /></form>                                            </div>\\r\\n                                        </div><!--END REVIEW FOOTER-->\\r\\n                                    </div><!--END REVIEW RIGHT CONTENT-->\\r\\n                                </div><!--END REVIEW ITEM-->\\r\\n                                <!-- START REVIEW ITEM-->\\r\\n                                <div class=\"row review\">\\r\\n                                    <!--START REVIEW LEFT CONTENT-->\\r\\n                                    <div class=\"col-sm-2 review-side\">\\r\\n                                        <div class=\"text-center margin-bottom-20\">\\r\\n                                            <img src=\"/Content/Images/anon.jpg\" data-type=\"avatar\" onLoad=\"$(this).data(\\'loaded\\', 1)\" onError=\"this.onerror=null;

MC can do no wrong and is unrealistically overpowered. The world revolves around him. Every female is pretty much just a hole for the MC to get his rocks off and has no personality of their own whatsoever, and doesn\\'t even garner any interest in the first place, nevermind losing said interest a chapter or two later.</p>\\r\\n<p>And yet, if you\\'re fifty or so chapters in and still get angry about any of that, what are you still doing here? I think the author meant for this to be a crack-fic. A joke. Something not to be taken seriously. If you are, then you\\'re at the wrong place. The only reason my rating is so bad is because he didn\\'t say any of that in the synopsis, only that there would be \"nastiness\" involved.</p>\\r\\n<p>It\\'s pretty much implied that this is just a joke from the very beginning. But really man, if you just tell people to expect a comedy instead of a mature action-adventure, you won\\'t get such angry reviews.</p>\\r\\n                                            </div>\\r\\n                                            <label for=\"rv-257977\" class=\"small bold uppercase\"></label>\\r\\n                                        <!--START REVIEW FOOTER-->\\r\\n                                        <div class=\"review-footer\">\\r\\n                                            <div class=\"btn-group btn-group-solid margin-bottom-10\">\\r\\n                                                <a href=\"/report/review/257977\" class=\"btn red\">\\r\\n                                                    <i class=\"fa fa-warning\"></i>\\r\\n                                                    Report\\r\\n                                                </a>\\r\\n                                            </div>\\r\\n                                            <div class=\"btn-group btn-group-solid pull-right\" style=\"float: right !important;\">\\r\\n<form action=\"/fictions/ratereview/257977\" class=\"inline-block\" method=\"post\">                                                    <button class=\"btn blue-dark\" name=\"up\" value=\"true\">\\r\\n                                                        <i class=\"fa fa-thumbs-up\"></i> 3\\r\\n                                                    </button>\\r\\n                                                    <button class=\"btn red-sunglo\" name=\"up\" value=\"false\">\\r\\n                                                        <i class=\"fa fa-thumbs-down\"></i> 1\\r\\n                                                    </button>\\r\\n<input name=\"__RequestVerificationToken\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"CfDJ8PgSJZb9k0RMmqo2aF0lNT6K4h-Pd0WaX1ZdiQvOViy0WftmpLAD1-RRKJBXmeMwrLesXO-rnrbLPs7NEJe402C2feTxTAbyzrTxx793og94kBDMbUjlkvgNMxGydi3a21v4SQ6Il7F3Bt2gnGMpzMg\" /></form>                                            </div>\\r\\n                                        </div><!--END REVIEW FOOTER-->\\r\\n                                    </div><!--END REVIEW RIGHT CONTENT-->\\r\\n                                </div><!--END REVIEW ITEM-->\\r\\n                                <!-- START REVIEW ITEM-->\\r\\n                                <div class=\"row review\">\\r\\n                                    <!--START REVIEW LEFT CONTENT-->\\r\\n                                    <div class=\"col-sm-2 review-side\">\\r\\n                                        <div class=\"text-center margin-bottom-20\">\\r\\n                                            <img src=\"https://www.royalroadcdn.com/redmanstrialsatwritting/9d05dbd3-35fe-41d4-8051-10243c21b160.png\" data-type=\"avatar\" onLoad=\"$(this).data(\\'loaded\\', 1)\" onError=\"this.onerror=null;

What is the point if everyone is doing the same? There\\'s no fun in being an horrendous person if no one important cares and if the only nuisances are \\'those darn light types!\\' who have sticks up their asses plues the way that every single \\'evil\\' action gets emphasized and made to be important is fucking annoying, yeah he ate the priestess and he punished his slave yadda yadda yadda what is the point, my boy, if the people either forget or have mild minor and forgettable reactions to him and his actions?</p>\\r\\n<p>Plus, he is the dumb version of a villain, the guy who puts his face out there and acts shameless with the cheesiest lines out there to justify his \\'evilness\\' that once again doesn\\'t exist because the people who are important don\\'t care either way the only effect it has on the plot is that since apparently every single important enemy or side kick in this fiction is a girl he can either add ehr to his harem or he can eat her.</p>\\r\\n<p>Now I\\'m not saying I know how to write non cheesy lines for characters but everything that happens in this story has the basis of \\'you know what? I\\'m going to do all the evil things! Rape? Sure thing! slavery? Why not!?\\' and so on and so forth but once again I ask you, what is the fun in being evil if everyone just likes you anyways?</p>\\r\\n<p>Plus he goes and gets the good \\'ole slave harem!

Read why first.</p>\\r\\n<p>This story is essentially the fantasy version of&nbsp;<em>Into The Black</em>. Only much less well-written. The story has next to plot, the encounters are all over the place and the charm character and slavemamcer are not the fun kinds.</p>\\r\\n<p>When I play RPG, I often find myself looking forward to the next level up and skill, but slavemancer pretty much explains itself. Afterwards, he did change his class into Hex Blade but the change did basically nothing as there is still no tension.</p>\\r\\n<p>Bosses die too quick, MC power-ups way too fast. Unlike the satisfied and excited feelings&nbsp;<em>Into The Black</em> gave me, I came out of this severely disappointed.</p>\\r\\n<p>As for characters... It\\'s a Mirikon story, all of them are gonna be fucked in the heads, what do you expect? Still, I find nothing interesting about character development, I doubt MC is gonna change anytime soon, if at all.</p>\\r\\n<p>The fighting scenes are lack-luster. No tension to be had since MC stealth-kills, schemes at almost every turns. It\\'d be fun if it only happen a time or two, but when he uses it for the tenth time, it just lost all meaning.</p>\\r\\n<p>And really? 20 inches dick? That\\'s fucking unreal, there\\'s nothing real about that shit. And it\\'s fucking retarded to have. Firstly its size would affect his agility, and I doubt it could fit in pants. Not to mention it\\'s an easy target for enemies to kick..</p>\\r\\n<p>I came pretty much for the genderbender tag, only to find it disappeared along the way. I pretty started to read&nbsp;<em>Into The Black</em> for the same reason, but stay because the story is good, at least way better than this. The characters there are also more diverse in personality. The women are not mindless sex-bots like in this one.</p>\\r\\n                                            </div>\\r\\n                                            <label for=\"rv-252996\" class=\"small bold uppercase\"></label>\\r\\n                                        <!--START REVIEW FOOTER-->\\r\\n                                        <div class=\"review-footer\">\\r\\n                                            <div class=\"btn-group btn-group-solid margin-bottom-10\">\\r\\n                                                <a href=\"/report/review/252996\" class=\"btn red\">\\r\\n                                                    <i class=\"fa fa-warning\"></i>\\r\\n                                                    Report\\r\\n                                                </a>\\r\\n                                            </div>\\r\\n                                            <div class=\"btn-group btn-group-solid pull-right\" style=\"float: right !important;\">\\r\\n<form action=\"/fictions/ratereview/252996\" class=\"inline-block\" method=\"post\">                                                    <button class=\"btn blue-dark\" name=\"up\" value=\"true\">\\r\\n                                                        <i class=\"fa fa-thumbs-up\"></i> 13\\r\\n                                                    </button>\\r\\n                                                    <button class=\"btn red-sunglo\" name=\"up\" value=\"false\">\\r\\n                                                        <i class=\"fa fa-thumbs-down\"></i> 6\\r\\n                                                    </button>\\r\\n<input name=\"__RequestVerificationToken\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"CfDJ8PgSJZb9k0RMmqo2aF0lNT6K4h-Pd0WaX1ZdiQvOViy0WftmpLAD1-RRKJBXmeMwrLesXO-rnrbLPs7NEJe402C2feTxTAbyzrTxx793og94kBDMbUjlkvgNMxGydi3a21v4SQ6Il7F3Bt2gnGMpzMg\" /></form>                                            </div>\\r\\n                                        </div><!--END REVIEW FOOTER-->\\r\\n                                    </div><!--END REVIEW RIGHT CONTENT-->\\r\\n                                </div><!--END REVIEW ITEM-->\\r\\n                                <!-- START REVIEW ITEM-->\\r\\n                                <div class=\"row review\">\\r\\n                                    <!--START REVIEW LEFT CONTENT-->\\r\\n                                    <div class=\"col-sm-2 review-side\">\\r\\n                                        <div class=\"text-center margin-bottom-20\">\\r\\n                                            <img src=\"/Content/Images/anon.jpg\" data-type=\"avatar\" onLoad=\"$(this).data(\\'loaded\\', 1)\" onError=\"this.onerror=null;

Just names things and people. We are introduced to \\'characters\\', who are described as \\'female... human\\' + name and that\\'s still all we know of them many chapters later. Appearance? Garb? such things don\\'t exist in this story. Similiarly no context is given for any locations - you have descriptions like \\'descended to next floor / entered a room - found X Enemy Types\\' than a fight description and good luck to the reader on trying to picture it. Sometimes there aren\\'t even details like whether the encounter is in a hall way, room whatever...<br /><br />We do know however the exact length and thickness of MC\\'s cock and that his hair is waist high. The \\'sexual content\\' tag is kind of misleading as the \\'scenes\\' manage to be less sexual than school biology textbooks. Expect lots of erotic descriptions such as \"I shoved my giant cock in her and fucked her for an hour. It was fun. Used XYZ skill to make her orgasm.\"<br /><br />Story: Frankly the LitRPG level and skills up flow so quickly and inconsistently that it was kind of pointless to keep track. There is no important link between the game system and story progression except to establish right from first chapter that MC is obscenely overpowered, and that the reader shouldn\\'t bother doubting that any fight will be anything other then a curbstomp. <br /><br />He is a powerful mage + overwhelming mind control powers + dual wielding Drizzit-copy and starts the game with custom set of weapons that scale to his level and power. At lvl 1, he takes out lvl 5 creatures without breaking a sweat. At level 7 he soloes parties of NPCs (as in Fighter, Barb, Rogue supported by Cleric and DPS Mage).<br /><br />And the whole thing is happening in a completely static world - for example that \\'fucked for an hour\\' bit I mentioned above? that was to a patrol of a cult preparing for a ritual. \"I lifted one leg up over my shoulder, and thrust into her. She screamed, but I kept going.\" - you immediately get a good gauge of how well though out the setting/story is when the MC can go into a dungeon, attack a patrol on perimeter of a cult that\\'s gettign ready for a critical ritual and rape a screaming cult member for an hour right on the spot where he found them, and no one interrupts them and everone is still surprised when he later tucks his dick in and proceeds deeper into the ruins. <br /><br />Oh and apparently when one is a \\'high\\' level caster class and thinks they have an advantage in spell might over an incubus that just barged in on your ritual, butchered all your followers, admitted to raping one of them, enslaved the second survivor right in front of you and than offer you a wager of a challenge fuck, promising to help you if you outfuck him - well the obvious choice is to accept, let yourself get stripped naked and spell bound. <br /><br />Yep... that is the level of intelligence that the author acribed to MC\\'s enemies - before he even starts using his mind control powers.<br /><br />Grammar score: author put in futas into the story and took the time to invent ridiculous sounding pronoun to refer to them... \\'hir\\' and \\'shi\\' galore. It comes off exactly as stupid sounding and annoying in middle of combat descriptions as one would expect.<br /><br />Tl,DR - System screens can be skipped as there is nothing important to story there, and fight scenes can all be skipped because you know how it ends. The characters aren\\'t characterized beyond name, sex, race, class and the \\'gripping story\\' involves overpowered MC vs. a world chock full of the dumbest NPCs ever written in a LitRPG. <br /><br />Re: \\'traumatizing content\\' tag - there is real edgy stuff here such as impaling women on a magic spit that heals them to make the experience longer lasting. Just for the fun of it - done to a complete stranger he just met, had no particular animosity for or anything to gain from the torture. But it\\'s okay - as even a priestess of the local goddess of Love and Passion doesn\\'t sweat the small stuff like still-living women being roasted on the fire nearby... not when there is this dashing incubus and his giant cock are in view and fade-to-black sex non-scene to be had. <br /><br />In fact, what kind of Goddess of Love and Passion wouldn\\'t rather bless said dashing succubus right on the spot?<br /><br />\"The elf maidens were a little discomfited to be eating human flesh\" - the maidens in question would be those good aligned priestesses... err sorry - Pincess Priestesses</p>\\r\\n<p>That should tell you what all the many mentiones of alignment systems and \\'potential consequences\\' might amount to in this world.<br /><br />Only got up to chapter 12 on this one.<br /><br /><br /></p>\\r\\n                                            </div>\\r\\n                                            <label for=\"rv-294734\" class=\"small bold uppercase\"></label>\\r\\n                                        <!--START REVIEW FOOTER-->\\r\\n                                        <div class=\"review-footer\">\\r\\n                                            <div class=\"btn-group btn-group-solid margin-bottom-10\">\\r\\n                                                <a href=\"/report/review/294734\" class=\"btn red\">\\r\\n                                                    <i class=\"fa fa-warning\"></i>\\r\\n                                                    Report\\r\\n                                                </a>\\r\\n                                            </div>\\r\\n                                            <div class=\"btn-group btn-group-solid pull-right\" style=\"float: right !important;\">\\r\\n<form action=\"/fictions/ratereview/294734\" class=\"inline-block\" method=\"post\">                                                    <button class=\"btn blue-dark\" name=\"up\" value=\"true\">\\r\\n                                                        <i class=\"fa fa-thumbs-up\"></i> 3\\r\\n                                                    </button>\\r\\n                                                    <button class=\"btn red-sunglo\" name=\"up\" value=\"false\">\\r\\n                                                        <i class=\"fa fa-thumbs-down\"></i> 2\\r\\n                                                    </button>\\r\\n<input name=\"__RequestVerificationToken\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"CfDJ8PgSJZb9k0RMmqo2aF0lNT6K4h-Pd0WaX1ZdiQvOViy0WftmpLAD1-RRKJBXmeMwrLesXO-rnrbLPs7NEJe402C2feTxTAbyzrTxx793og94kBDMbUjlkvgNMxGydi3a21v4SQ6Il7F3Bt2gnGMpzMg\" /></form>                                            </div>\\r\\n                                        </div><!--END REVIEW FOOTER-->\\r\\n                                    </div><!--END REVIEW RIGHT CONTENT-->\\r\\n                                </div><!--END REVIEW ITEM-->\\r\\n                                <!-- START REVIEW ITEM-->\\r\\n                                <div class=\"row review\">\\r\\n                                    <!--START REVIEW LEFT CONTENT-->\\r\\n                                    <div class=\"col-sm-2 review-side\">\\r\\n                                        <div class=\"text-center margin-bottom-20\">\\r\\n                                            <img src=\"/Content/Images/anon.jpg\" data-type=\"avatar\" onLoad=\"$(this).data(\\'loaded\\', 1)\" onError=\"this.onerror=null;

There books that are even more creepy, trust me. But non of them have reviews saying the book is to creepy.

href=\"http://frozensoulandotherworks.blogspot.com/2016/06/patreon-goals-and-rewards.html\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>\\xc2\\xa0where I talk about a few things I\\'m considering doing, involving both this story, and Frozen Soul. One of the possible rewards includes being able to help create members of Zayn\\'s <del>harem</del>\\xc2\\xa0party! I\\'ve also got a goal for including \\'extended editions\\' of some chapters of both stories, starting with expanding V1, C5 of Frozen Soul, From Russia with Blood.\\r<br />\\r<br />\\r<br /><hr />\\r<br />\\r<br />The next morning, my pets and I had gathered in the Inn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s common room to enjoy a nice breakfast. It was simple fare, just some eggs, bacon, bread with butter, and mead to drink with it. Tasty as hell, though. Too many people go and try to make things \\xe2\\x80\\x98fancy\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and end up overcomplicating things. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a time for fancy dishes, but a simple meal can do a lot to help a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mood. And I was in a good mood. I found that you get a small amount of XP for performing acts related to your profession. So me training the girls last night gave me a couple hundred XP. Not much, but still something.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />While we were eating, the Princesses came down. I smiled when they came over to my table, and we began chatting about how we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d spent the last couple days. The fact that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d gotten to rank E in my initial assessment by the guild was impressive to them. I also mentioned that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d taken a couple quests out towards Wyrmwood, so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be able to start moving before too long.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />As for what the priestesses were up to, they had been training, it seemed, so that they could better defend themselves if trouble came up. We agreed to check in with eachother tonight at dinner, but be prepared to leave the city tomorrow, if need be.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Of course, leaving on a journey isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly simple. We needed supplies, and preferably transportation. I had considered buying horses, but strong horses, capable of carrying a rider over long distances would not be affordable just yet. But a wagon and a couple draft horses just might be. And then there was the issue of supplies. Food, water, and feed for the animals. Plus, survival gear like tents. Lots of stuff to buy.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />After breakfast, we returned to the marketplace. This time, however, we visited more of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98mundane\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shops. The Princesses would take care of their own supplies, but that still left me with the burden of paying for the rest (after all, any funds my pets had made since I got them went directly to me). Fortunately, I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t without resources. And by resources, I mean a gamer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to sniff out cheats.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />A bit of asking around told me that Brum Farshade and his wife, Airhy, were trying to have a child, but things were \\xe2\\x80\\x98difficult\\xe2\\x80\\x99 since Airhy had been injured early in life. A bit more asking around (and a couple drinks), and I found out that Airhy was actually sweet on this guardsman and had been taking an alchemist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work to keep from getting pregnant. Now, none of this was my business, but Brum was the guy who ran the stables, and so when I introduced myself as a servant of Sharess, who had come after hearing of his difficulties, I was able to get a discounted price on a pair of draft horses, a wagon, and harnesses, in return for the blessing of the Goddess upon their bed. I cast Fruitful Passion on the husband, and told him that, so long as he lay with his wife, and no other, before the new moon, then he would have the child he sought.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />After that, a trip to the general store was in order. A lot of haggling ensued, and my Negotiation skill went up to Beginner 6. But I managed to get rations and feed for ten days, canteens with water for 4 days (which we could refill along the way), tents, bedrolls, a healthy supply of rope, and other sundry supplies. Honestly, boring stuff.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Anyways, all the supplies cost me 10 GP. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be ready for pretty much anything that happened. After that, I went to talk to my two contacts for the quests. Hard to deliver goods or escort merchants without speaking face to face, after all.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I started with Hunter Becket. Becket, as it turned out, was a Halfling, a half-human. Looked like his other half was goblin. He also was missing the better part of his left leg. But whatever. He was most happy to talk to me once I explained I was here about the quest.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #339933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, good! I was supposed to source ten Black Forest Wolf pelts for the leatherworker, but got caught in a storm, and my wagon wrecked. I was barely able to save the furs. Then more wolves attacked me, and I ended up in this state. A merchant brought me to Falon, and now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m stuck doing chores at the temple until I can save up enough for some healing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />After a few mindless pleasantries, I received the 10 furs, and stored them in my inventory.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Oddly enough, I found Silas Horneby at the slave market. Turns out, he was a traveling slave trader, moving \\xe2\\x80\\x98goods\\xe2\\x80\\x99 from one area to another. We actually had a good chat over lunch in a private room. The guy wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a cruel bastard. Most of the people who were put in his keeping were sold to pay off debts, or because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d broken some law. He tried to find them good owners, and had actually developed something of a reputation along those lines.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />For my part, I simply told him stories of my adventures back in WoD. The game settings said that Travelers came from another world, so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what all the NPCs believed anyways. Made it so I could tell some of my early adventures without drawing too much attention.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Small talk out of the way, we agreed to move out tomorrow morning.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #9999ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope things will go smoothly. These bandits on the road lately\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, I heard about them. Are we expecting trouble? More than the usual?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #9999ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, one of my cargo is the son of a bandit leader. The little prick was caught trying to raid one of the storehouses here in the city. City leaders want him gone, and they paid me double the normal rate to try and get him elsewhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, so we can definitely expect trouble, then. My pets and I have stocked up on supplies already, so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be ready to go in the morning. Do any of your slaves have combat training? If we come into a tight spot, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be good to know how many blades we can rely on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #9999ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA couple. But the only one worth talking about is my personal slave, who is practiced in defensive magics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight. Hopefully we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need it, but it is good to know that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s someone strong behind us, in case we get attacked from both sides. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to assume that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll lay ambushes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #9999ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah. Fortunately, your group aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only guards. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another party of adventurers who also accepted the quest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcellent! Then let us hope that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have enough numbers to keep the bastards\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heads down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />After agreeing to meet at the city gates the next morning just after breakfast, we went our separate way. Pets in tow, I headed to the training hall. Why? Because I wanted to grind my skills some more. My Sword skills were already quite good for my level, so I started raising my other masteries, with the Dagger, Whip, and Bow. The others were also working on their weapon skills, even Della. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going out into the wild, so we need to be ready for things.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Honestly, apart from grinding my masteries, the practice was really for Yukiko. From what she had said, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been enslaved directly out of the tutorial, and it was only by doing a LOT of service-based quests that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d managed to get to her current level. So she had no combat experience in this world. And even in WoD, she was a Blacksmith first, and fighter second, so her combat skills needed the work badly.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Finally, it was about time for dinner, when I had promised that we would meet the Princesses again to discuss our plans. Unfortunately, we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t able to return to the inn directly. Why? Because some idiots had noticed my good fortune (three female slaves following a guy around attracts attention), and decided it was their place to make me share the wealth, either by giving them the girls, or paying them with my deep pockets. I used Observe on them, and laughed.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\\'4\\'>Thief\\r<br />Human Male\\r<br />Level 8 Rogue</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />There were seven of those, but the eighth proved to be much more interesting.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\\'4\\'>Zephara Void\\r<br />Half-Elf Female\\r<br />Level 15 Flame Sorceress\\r<br />Title: Chainbreaker\\r<br />Bounty: 500 GP</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\\r<br />\\r<br />This wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an NPC leading these goons, but a player! And that Chainbreaker title sounded like the opposite of mine. Probably meant she went around freeing a bunch of slaves. And no doubt killing a bunch of people along the way. No other way a Level 15 gets a 500 GP bounty on them.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />The group tried to cut us off, four ahead and four behind, with the sorceress behind us. Poor bastards. Then this Zephara spoke. <span style=\"color: #ff9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, this is how it is. You give me the girls, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make your death quick. You resist, you burn slow. Either way, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to kill a sicko like you for taking slaves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I simply laughed, and said,<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"> \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, really? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so going to enjoy this. So tell me, how many innocent slave owners have you killed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really care. But her talking was convenient to me.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #ff9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInnocent?! You ba\\xe2\\x80\\x94MPH!!!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> See, this is why you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t monologue. Wannabe freer of slaves just got a mouth full of tentacle, with the other two binding her in place. Level is important in this game, but skills and control are more important. This idiot hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even mastered silent casting, it seems, since no fire comes out when she struggles against the tentacles.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYukiko, keep the three behind busy. Severa, help her out. Della, buff and heal them. Let me know if the cocky bitch gets free or starts using magic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9dYes, Master!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> All three reply at once. Severa especially looks to be happy to have something to take her frustrations out on.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I turn back to the four in front, and decide to make it quick, rather than play around. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give your enemies openings they can exploit! With a cry, I leap at the closest of the four and perform a beautiful iaijutsu slash, if I do say so myself. While the thieves may be a decent level, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re glass cannons, focusing mainly on DEX. The thief didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have time to know what happened, as his head separated from his body.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />The death broke the thieves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 stupor at the sudden onslaught, and they began to attack. In the back, one of the thieves looked to be trying to free the sorceress, but unfortunately he was hampered by the presence of a dagger in his throat and kidney, care of Severa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s de-stealthing form. The other two tried to get to her, but were blocked by Yukiko\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blade, which took off one thief\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm in the first swing. The other managed to slip his blade into Yukiko\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side, but the wound was healed almost instantly by Della.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />As for my three? Well, they were having even less fun than those guys. Instead of the Sun Blade, I held my Sacrificial Dagger in my off hand, and buried it in the chest of one of the thieves. I crouched into a spin, missing a sword aimed at my neck, and slashed out with Munsuraisa, taking out the remaining two at the knees. A moment later, each had been slain by the dagger. \\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />By the time I was finished, my pets had ended their play, as well, leaving only the sorceress to deal with. And I knew just what to do with HER! Reaching into my inventory, I pulled out one of the cheap copper chain necklaces I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d stripped from the cultists, but never sold. The reason I never sold them was because they made good for nice, classy slave chokers. When I slipped the necklace around Zephara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neck, a flurry of messages appeared, as combat had ended.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\\'4\\'>From sacrificing your enemies, you gain 8 DEX!</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\\r<br />\\r<br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\\'4\\'>You have defeated Thief x7!

Picked the wrong person to fight, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #ff9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou BASTARD! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to kill you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cZephara, strip naked, and hand all your belongings to Della. I forbid you from logging out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> Honestly, I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure whether that would work. Surely the company would have put in some kind of safeguard? Well, charm and enslavement magic does work on the character\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d found that out from Yukiko already, so it just might keep a player from logging out. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be the forced log out if they stayed on long enough to risk their health, but then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d still be in the same trouble once they logged back in. They would be forced to either live as a slave, make a new character, or quit the game entirely.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Zephara kept up a constant stream of abuse as she got naked, but was unable to log out, even though I saw her trying to make the motions to press the button on her menu, but stopping herself each time. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cZephara, place your hands behind your head, fingers laced with one another.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> That shut her up as she was forced to present herself for the whole city.<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"> \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be happy to know that this will be streaming very shortly. But for now, it seems I have more business before dinner. And do not speak until told otherwise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />When I led her to one of the local brothels, she looked panicked, and tried to beg as much as she could with her hands clasped behind her head and being unable to speak. This particular brothel enjoyed the patronage of many of the city guard. Given that she was a notorious outlaw who (until recently) had a high bounty on their head, she was sure to be popular. So I was happy to get another 50 GP for her.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Della looked puzzled as we walked back to the inn for dinner. <span style=\"color: #ff3333;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaster, why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you just keep her, or at least rape her before selling her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, unlike Yukiko here, I doubt she enjoys the thought of being a slave, especially as she was going around freeing slaves all over the place. Now, that wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother me, but Travelers can be an annoying bunch, especially when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pissed off. So it would be more trouble than it was worth to keep her. Especially since once she is forced to return to the world we Travelers come from, she most likely won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be back, at least not in that form. She may still return to try and cause trouble, but it will take her a very long time to catch up and find us, and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be far weaker for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xc2\\xa0</span>\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs for why I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rape her? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to spoil the experience for her clients.

/>It was nice learning more about my pets. That Severa was actually related to the royal family of Caledon was something to think on later. If my journeys took me that way, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d probably have to be careful. It would either make things easier, or much, much harder. Hard to tell.<br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />Anyways, the slave market! It was\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 pretty much just like I expected it to be. Walking through the door, I was in a nicely appointed receiving room. The way the market worked is that you spoke with an \\xe2\\x80\\x98agent\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98hostess\\xe2\\x80\\x99 while relaxing in a private room, and told them the requirements you wished for in a slave. Then they would go and bring in several slaves for you to pick from, and eventually you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d narrow things down, and you could discuss price. There were two reasons for this. First, it meant they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to have all their product on display all the time, which would drive down their living conditions. Second, it was the time honored tactic of drawing up the price once you hooked your customer on something they wanted.<br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />The hostess showed us into a private room, and I sat on a soft chair, and commanded my pets to kneel on either side of me. Part of this was for my own ego, naturally, but the main reason was theater. Framing the scene the way I wished, to elicit the proper responses both from the slaves, and from the slavers. If the slave reacted badly to my little harem, that told me something. Also, conveying to the slaver that I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t desperate would help keep the cost from getting out of hand.<br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />As a servant brought me a glass of wine, the hostess came in, and said,<span style=\"color: #669933;\"> \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWelcome to Zechariah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Slave Emporium!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> As she spoke, I took a moment to observe the woman. She was a shapely red-head, but I could see a slave collar on her. So a trusted slave in charge of sales? Well, sex sells, so I can see the point. <span style=\"color: #669933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat can we help you with today?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, first, I would like to gain training in the Slave Trainer profession. Second, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m an adventurer, and will be heading out on a long journey. As such, I would prefer to have an additional fighter in my company.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #669933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnderstood. Would you prefer a male or female slave?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFemale.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #669933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny other requirements?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would prefer a warrior of some sort.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #669933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good. I will be back shortly with a selection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> Bowing slightly, the hostess turned and left the room, her hips swaying seductively as she went. Yes, sex sells indeed. This Zachariah was a clever man.<br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />I sipped the wine carefully, not wishing it to go to my head. That wine was provided free of charge was yet another point showing that Zachariah knew his business. Before long, a man entered, and nodded to me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">Ah, so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the one Shelly told me about, hmm? Already got a start as a slave trainer, I see, but you need full training, then? Oh, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Zachariah, by the by.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />I got up to offer the man my hand, with a respectful nod. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA pleasure, sir. It would be my honor to learn the profession from one as obviously skilled as you are. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve rarely seen a slave market so well run.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFlattery! But that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get you a discount!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> Zachariah laughed, and then said, <span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, the cost to train will be five silver. That won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a problem, will it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> I handed over the money obediently. No sense pissing off the people I needed things from. Being polite might get me a better deal, after all.<br /><br /><br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Slave Trainer profession fully unlocked!<br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />Gain +10% to Training<br />Gain +15% to Whip Mastery<br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />Level 10: Obedience Training \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Slaves under your command are more obedient, and better at following orders.

So in addition to the other things, I got a bonus to my \\xe2\\x80\\x98training\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98whip\\xe2\\x80\\x99 skills. Guess that made sense. That reminded me, that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have to get a whip. Della already had one thanks to the gear we got from the Priestess, but I needed one of my own. More things to buy after getting a new slave. Ah well.<br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />While I waited, Zachariah and I chatted about things. Nothing world shaking, of course, but when he found I was a Traveler, we quickly began sharing information. General information about this world was of little value to him, while information about my world was of great value, since it would better allow him to hawk his wares to the Travelers coming in. Likewise, what I needed was information on this world. No contracts needed, or agreements struck, and I think we each profited more from the conversation than the other realized.<br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />Now the hostess returned, leading in a group of ten women, all clad in basic leather armor, gladiator style. There was a mix of races presented, including three humans, two dwarves, four beastkin (two tigers, a fox, and wolf), and a draconian!

They seem awfully high leveled to be slaves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />Zachariah chuckled, and said, <span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I never bothered asking too closely, but it seems the dwarf has a bad habit. She gets preachy about the Light and all that if no one orders her to be silent. My personal guess is that someone slapped the collar on her to shut her up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />I laughed, and said, <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven in another world, zealots will be zealots. And what of the draconian?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, well she is a special case. It seems she killed several noblemen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sons in a brawl. The courts sentenced her to slavery. Normally it would be death for something like that, but it seems one of the dead started it, so the judge gave her the option of slavery instead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />I nodded. Killing a person could get you in trouble, depending on who it was. Killing the sons of several noblemen? That was going to get you in deep, unless you did it somewhere out of sight, and disposed of the evidence. Just like in the real world. Killing a junky in the alley isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to get much attention from the cops. Killing the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son in the middle of Times Square is going to get you killed, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re lucky.<br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the two tigerkin? Are they sisters?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, good eye! Indeed they are. Unfortunately, their father was unable to pay his debts, and sold his daughters to make good. They can be sold singly or as a set, if you like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />Hmm. A set of tigerkin? That was certainly worth thinking about. But my eye returned to the Foxkin. That name and class\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 nah, it couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the fox?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />The man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face fell. <span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh. A recent acquisition, and not quite tamed yet. She is a Traveler. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure, but she may have offended one of the gods, as she suddenly appeared in the receiving room one day, with a collar already on her neck.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo she isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t broken, yet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, but you asked for warriors. Most of our slaves are here for other purposes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, of course. And what is the price on this foxkin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf she was fully trained, a Traveler sex slave collared with a collar that will remain with them even after they return from death would be worth at least a thousand gold. For a combat slave, at least a couple hundred. Untrained, however, and as a combat slave, I would say twenty gold, and I hold no responsibility for what happens after.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the weapons and armor she appeared with?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIncluded, naturally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHmm. Twenty is a little much for something like this, especially as I will have to train her while traveling the wilds. Ten gold.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><span style=\"color: #cc9933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, you jest, surely! A traveler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to resurrect from death is worth twice that, at least! Eighteen!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span><br />\\xc2\\xa0<br />We haggled back and forth, and eventually settled on 15 GP, 3 SP, 5 CP. With that, I completed the process of transferring the slave collar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership over to myself, and I now had a new slave.<br />\\xc2\\xa0<br /><div class=\\'spoiler\\'><div class=\\'smalltext\\' style=\\'margin-bottom:2px\\'><b>Spoiler</b> : <input type=\\'button\\' value=\\'Show\\' class=\\'spoilerButton\\'></div><div class=\\'spoilerContent\\'><div style=\\'display: none;\\'><br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%;

Note:\\r<br />So, some people have reviewed my fiction poorly. No prob, I\\'m mainly writing this for fun, so trying to please everyone isn\\'t on the agenda. I\\'m just happy that even my poor reviews say that I\\'ve got good grammar. They might not like what I\\'m writing, but at least they agree I\\'m doing well technically.\\r<br />\\r<br />I somehow suspect that the people who didn\\'t like it never bothered reading the note on the main page, where I specifically mentioned the comic version of Wanted. Others are questioning why the MC is acting like he is, so I thought I\\'d give a brief explanation.\\r<br />\\r<br />I come from a tabletop RPG background. Namely, D&D being the place I got my start. Most groups (regardless of series) focus on being \\'good guys\\', if only because most GMs don\\'t know how to react when a party just happily murders their way through an orphanage. But every so often, a group that has been comprised of heroes up to this point will suddenly play an evil campaign. Those of you who play tabletop RPGs know that what happens next can often make what I\\'ve written in this story seem tame by comparison.\\r<br />\\r<br />In Wanted, the main character has been basically whipped his whole life. Until he finds out his dad (who is now dead) was a supervillain, and his old buddies come to recruit him to the Fraternity (and beat all that \\'empathy\\' out of him). Faced with the sudden reality of being able to do anything he wants, consequence free, he goes a bit crazy with things, eventually culminating with him kicking in the doors of a police station, shooting all the officers except for a single female cop. He\\'s about to rape her, when he hesitates, and starts crying. Fox, his partner in crime, tells him that they all hit that wall, at some point, burning out on the casual rape and murder, and then getting down to business, being able to do what they want. Sometimes that\\'s a night in, or watching a movie. Sometimes that\\'s murdering someone that gets on your nerves.\\r<br />\\r<br />I bring this up because Zayn is going through this right now. After 16 in-game years of playing Superman, all truth and justice and bright shiny lights, he\\'s going with the Joker on this one. Eventually, he\\'ll hit that wall, and settle down a bit, but until then, he\\'s going to go over the top, simply because he can.\\r<br />\\r<br /><hr />\\r<br />\\r<br />It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take me long to figure out how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d decided on the four classes. Warlock was clearly focused on dark magic, and probably had some nasty debuffs and DOTs in their arsenal. Beguiler was like a magical con artist, focusing on charm magics. Dominator looked like a glorified pet class, where everything went into raising your army of minions (except instead of pokemon you had slave girls, I guess). Blackguard was clearly focused on melee fighting, which made sense since I had good sword skills by now.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Each choice basically focused you on one route of advancement. Sure, I could, say, be a Beguiler and still use my Dark magic, but the Dark wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t advance at the same rate as my Charm magic. Plus, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get special class bonuses, and maybe even unique spells and abilities. In addition, the three \\xe2\\x80\\x98advances\\xe2\\x80\\x99 all looked to be focusing on an aspect of the class itself. The Blackguard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Death Knight probably focused heavily on survival and debuffs, while the Slaughterlord focused on DPS and the Tyrant probably focused on leadership or something, giving bonuses to party and raid groups.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Considering to myself for a moment, I queried the system for information on classes, subclasses, and professions.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\\'4\\'>Class Information\\r<br />Classes in Age of Anarchy Online are not like those in other games. Because of how AAO is structured, most choices are available to players regardless of class, provided they put the time and effort in. Classes, however, provide bonuses to certain aspects, and may also include unique skills. Every ten levels, new class abilities are unlocked. At Level 40 players gain the option to advance their class to an Advanced Class. Advanced Classes have prerequisites you must meet before they can be unlocked. Special actions may unlock hidden or unique Advanced Classes.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\\r<br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\\'4\\'>Subclass Information\\r<br />At Level 20, players unlock the ability to gain a subclass. This is not an extension of the primary class, but a second base class. Unlike with your primary class, you must meet certain prerequisites before being allowed to take a subclass. (Example: a Monk who wants to be a Sorcerer as his subclass must have a suitable level of INT, and at least Basic-level skill in one or more types of magic.) Subclasses unlock new abilities every 20 levels instead of every 10. At level 60, players may advance their Subclass into an Advanced Subclass.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\\r<br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\\'4\\'>Profession Information\\r<br />Unlike in other games, where you must have a profession to practice a trade (i.e. must be a Tailor to make your own cloth armor), this is not the case in AAO. However, having a profession provides a bonus to certain skills, as well as potentially unlocking unique abilities based on the profession. A Tailor may gain a bonus to their Tailoring skill, and their works will be higher quality than a non-Tailor. Additionally, some recipes and gear may require the Tailor profession to use. You may only have one profession at a time. Changing your old profession to a new one costs more gold the higher level you are, and the more times you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve changed professions, so it is recommended that players choose a profession, and stick with it. Professions unlock special abilities every ten levels.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Huh. That was actually pretty cool, once you got down to it. Sure, your subclass got slower ability gains, but you could still build a lot of interesting characters. There were a lot of ways to go with that, depending on whether you were solo, a raider, or PVP. And the Professions made sense. Anyone could craft, if they had the skills, but a Blacksmith was going to turn out higher quality weapons than a guy who just took the Blacksmith skill. So, probably meant a bit more damage, durability, or chance of higher grades with the same materials.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />That left me with the question of what being a Slave Trainer would give me, once I start working on it. I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t visited the trainer yet, so some of my abilities were still locked.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />For now, Della and I needed classes, the two girls needed professions, and we all needed gear. Some of the gear I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d gotten from the dead guys back at the temple would do nicely, but most of it would get sold, and hopefully we could get more stuff. Oh, and maybe visit the slave market to see if there was anything worth getting that would add to the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strength.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Well, classes first. I got directions from the clerk, but before we left, I stopped at the counter where you could sell old gear. Time to empty out my inventory a bit. After looking things over, I decided to sell almost all of the weapons and armor. They were all basic stuff, and not worth going to the auction house over. The only exceptions I made was the Priestess\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gear. Since they came off a level 10 area boss, that made them better than beginner gear, and would work fine for Della once she got her class change. Severa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gear was better than any the cultists had, especially for a rogue like herself, so I left her gear alone for the moment. I kept all the jewelry and other accessories. I was going to grind my Enchantment on them, and put most on the auction house. Anyways, all told, the loot came to an impressive 20 GP. As I thought, that \\xe2\\x80\\x98tutorial\\xe2\\x80\\x99 really ramped up the difficulty because I was OP.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Fathon was a decent-sized city for a medieval world, but there was no way they could have a temple dedicated to each of the gods here, even the main ones. Just too many. So they did something pretty smart, and put single building up, where all the gods were worshipped. This was the case in most towns, unless an area had a really high connection to a particular diety. Like a town in the tundra would have a temple of Auril, period. Even then, though, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be sub-shrines to different dieties.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Religion in AAO was interesting. The gods were (for the most part) neither good nor evil, but more \\xe2\\x80\\x98natural\\xe2\\x80\\x99, I guess. Just like people, the gods had their good and their bad sides. Of course, some HEAVILY leaned one way or another, though. That said, picking a patron deity didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean you couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t offer a prayer to other gods, especially when intruding on their domain. Anyone who took a sea voyage without offering a prayer to Poseidon was either an idiot, or one of the truly devout of another god. But having a patron, and praying to that patron, especially when embarking on ventures in their portfolio, was rumored to have an increased chance of good things happening. Like with the Luck stat, no one was really sure just how far that went, though.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />At the temple, it cost just five silver for a Priest of Moradin to bestow the class upon Della. It seemed she got bonuses to her divine spells, and some other goodies, I paid another silver to get her a holy symbol of Loviatar that she could wear around her neck over her clothes. That simple action gave her a +30% resistance against hostile divine spells! I was going to enchant that symbol later to help it provide more bonuses.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Now that Della had her class, it was time for me to get mine. This required us to walk a bit, but not too far. Turning the corner into an alleyway just before we got to the marketplace, we descended a set of stone steps into the basement of a certain business. It was a pet store. Not dogs and cats, though they had stuff like that, too, but things like familiars, and even some pets that might be useful in combat. But familiars were pretty useless, except as something pretty to look at, and I had two of those already. And combat pets were expensive as hell, since they were actually damn useful.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Sidetracked again. Down the stairs, we opened a door, and walked into the place where I would be able to get my class, the Dark Shrine. The place was dimly lit, but I could tell this was a one stop shop for dark magic. Almost like a food court, but with one counter selling Dark Magic spellbooks, another covering rituals, one with ritual ingredients, and one with special class gear. In the center was an altar, and I could see fresh blood on it as I moved forward. Being a Warlock didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t immediately make you evil, but you stare into the Abyss\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Anyways, I went to the trainer, who was this human guy dressed all in black, with a hooded robe and everything. Clich\\xc3\\xa9 much? His name was Varric Bane, and was apparently a Level 60 Warlock, according to \\xe2\\x80\\x98Observe\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #666633;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreetings young one. And what brings you to this place of shadow today? And with such lovelies behind you, too?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cElder, my name is Zayn Darkmore, and I am a Traveler. I have come here this day to set out upon the path of a Warlock. I captured these two ladies in battle, and they are now bound to my will.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #666633;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well, manners, and yet you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also willing to embrace the dark! Such a rarity these days. Tell me, boy, what is it that you seek?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish to do as I please. For that, I need power, both to defend myself and to ensure that any who cross me will regret it for the rest of their lives, however short that may be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #666633;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, a good answer for one setting out on the paths of darkness. Most of you Travelers that come to me simply look for a chance to slaughter the innocent. They do not realize that dark and light are not the same as good and evil. It merely reflects how far you are willing to go in order to achieve your goals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Zayn nodded. This followed much his own thoughts in real life, even though he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d spent ages playing a righteous type in his last game. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen how should I begin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #666633;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing without a price, my child. To become a Warlock, blood must be shed, and you must take in the power of the lower planes. Are you willing to do this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow much blood, and from whom? And what effects will this power have upon me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #666633;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHoh! So you know how to ask the right questions, hmm? Well, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry, it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t anything like sacrificing someone. Sure, high level rituals call for a sacrifice, but this is just a pittance in comparison. Just cut your arm, and allow a few drops of blood to spill on the altar. And then hold on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Right, so this is going to be painful as hell, probably. Oh well, might as well get on with it. I pulled out my knife, and made a quick cut across my palm, before holding it over the altar. Before long, the blood began to drip down. When the fifth drop of blood hit the stone altar, green flames rose up on the altar, and then they rushed into me. Oh yes, this was going to SUCK! \\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Getting roasted alive is not on my list of top ten ways to go out. And I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even die. Hell, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even lose any HP, other than what the knife had done. But the PAIN! I thought I heard screaming. Oh wait, that was me. Everything went black for a second\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />When I came to, I was sprawled on my back next to my slaves. Neither one had moved to help. In Della\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, it was probably because I was on fire, and she saw my HP wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t moving. In Severa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, she was probably hoping my death would free her. It wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, of course, since I was a Traveler and not a Native. But she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that. Not yet.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\\'4\\'>Class Changed!\\r<br />New Class: Warlock\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Class benefits:\\r<br />+20% with Dark Spells\\r<br />+20 MP per Level\\r<br />Light Armor Proficiency\\r<br />Hellfire Proficiency\\r<br />Hellfire Mastery Skill\\r<br />New Spells added!</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n            <h6 class=\"bold uppercase text-center\">Advertisement</h6>\\r\\n            <div class=\"wide text-center \">\\r\\n                <!-- /268575356/RR_Content_Mid_Desktop -->\\r\\n<div id=\\'div-gpt-ad-1442371043694-3\\' adonis-marker data-pan-sizes=\\'[[300,250],[336,280],[728,90]]\\'>\\r\\n<script type=\\'text/javascript\\'>\\r\\nif(true) {googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\'div-gpt-ad-1442371043694-3\\');

decent weapon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s store. Yukiko had a beginner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sword and armor. While better than anything else my group had, that was still level 1 gear. Not going to cut it. Looking over my shoulder, I said to my new pet,<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"> \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, Yukiko, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your story? How\\xe2\\x80\\x99d a Traveler end up a slave?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Yukiko\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head fell, and she said, <span style=\"color: #ff3333;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I reincarnated my high level character from WOD here. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t max level, but I was one of the high level blacksmiths in my guild, the Lords of Light. Unfortunately, I ran into some trouble with character creation. The abilities I got turned problematic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I saw them on your status. Tell me what they mean. In detail, if you will.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Now she was blushing furiously. Oh, this had to be good!\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #ff3333;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hurts so Good\\xe2\\x80\\x99 converts all pain my character experiences into pleasure. I still take damage, but my avatar responds differently to it than others. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Senpai Noticed Me!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gives me a +100% to any actions I take for 10 minutes after getting praised by someone important to me. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Art of the Forge\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gives me the Blacksmith profession, and Blacksmith at Basic 3, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m able to repair gear without losing any durability. \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Story of O\\xe2\\x80\\x99, um, gave me this collar, and made me start as a slave. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Lady Luck\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fool\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sets my Luck to 0, and it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ever be raised. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Gullible\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Travels\\xe2\\x80\\x99 means that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m -30% to discern truth from lies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I stood for a moment, stunned, and then laughed out loud. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo your browser history must be pretty interesting, Yukiko. So, why did you reincarnate to AAO?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #ff3333;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUm, I had a crush on the guild leader, Torgan. He was the top Paladin in the game, you know! After we got the guild achievement for being the first to beat Frostcrown, he announced that he would be reincarnating here. I thought I could come too, and maybe get to know him better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you chased this Torgan to a new game. Did you tell him you were doing so? Or make any plans to meet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #ff3333;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUm, no. I was always shy around the guild leader.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, what, you were just hoping to randomly find this person in the entire game world? And what if he went by a different name?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #ff3333;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think about that!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry, pet. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll show you things you never dreamed of, even with that kinky browser history. Before I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m done, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll forget all about Torgan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I was laughing to myself as we went about our shopping. To think that Kiyabu Yukiko, the former Warrior and max level blacksmith, would come chasing after me with some schoolgirl crush. She didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even change her name! Anyways, I decided to get just a few basic items for Yukiko, since we could probably get better off drops. Also, I picked up a whip for myself.

Hey! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ignore me, damnit!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I did ignore her, as I went to the counter. The clerk looked like he was trying desperately not to laugh, so I cut him a break, and spoke first. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, my name is Zayn Darkmore. I was to pick up my guild card today.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #99cc33;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cY-yes, of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> He pulled a card out from under the desk, and said, <span style=\"color: #99cc33;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need a drop of blood to bind it to you, after which, it will automatically update your guild status whenever you complete quests or have other achievements of note.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> I pricked my finger, and dropped a bit of blood on the card.<span style=\"color: #99cc33;\"> \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcellent. It appears that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been evaluated as a Rank E adventurer to start. Impressive for a newcomer.

And it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give away any really bad information. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure criminal guilds had fake versions available, if I wanted to go that route. Meanwhile, the clerk was still talking, while the instructor looked like she was about to explode due to my ignoring her.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #99cc33;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe guild card is accepted as proper identification in all lands; the Adventurer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Guild is not bound by national ties. You may store currency on your card, if you wish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Ah, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s convenient. All those coins in my inventory were taking up space. When I put them on the card, I noticed something even more convenient. Instead of just tallying the number of coins on the card, they were converted to the smallest number possible. 14 GP, 32 SP, and 140 CP became 18 GP, 6 SP. When I asked the clerk about it, he simply said that it was part of the card\\xe2\\x80\\x99s magic.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #cccc33;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHEY! STOP IGNORING ME, DAMNIT!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I turned to look at the Instructor, and smiled.<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"> \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry, did you wish something, Instructor? I was going to entertain my new slave after dinner, but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re welcome to join in, if you like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #cccc33;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou bastard!

She froze, looked quickly at the attention we most definitely were attracting, and then turned and stormed off towards the stairs, muttering as she did so.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Looking back to the clerk, I said, <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be heading to the Wyrmwood soon, do you know of any quests leading in that direction?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />The clerk, after he finished laughing, directed me to the quest board, and I picked out a few quests that would work.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><div class=\\'spoiler\\'><div class=\\'smalltext\\' style=\\'margin-bottom:2px\\'><b>Spoiler</b> : <input type=\\'button\\' value=\\'Show\\' class=\\'spoilerButton\\'></div><div class=\\'spoilerContent\\'><div style=\\'display: none;\\'>\\r<br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\\'3\\'>New Quest: Bandit Subjugation\\r<br />Bandits have been causing trouble along the Vermillion Road between Falon and Wyrmwood.

If you endure everything I am about to do to you without logging out, then I will tell you something about Torgan that you will be only the second person in this world to know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Oh, how her eyes lit up with both fear and excitement! I was going to thoroughly enjoy this. When she finally nodded her head, I smiled, and said, <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, strip.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />&lt;Della POV&gt;\\r<br />Master is so wicked! The Traveler he purchased at the market has no idea what she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in for, but she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to go along with it blindly because she wants to know more about this \\xe2\\x80\\x98Torgan\\xe2\\x80\\x99. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to see her delicious pain when he takes her. Oh, wait, she said something about having an ability that turned pain to pleasure, right? Well, that takes some of the fun out of it.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I wonder what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do to the girl? And what is this secret? Is it related to Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredible strength?\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />&lt;Severa POV&gt;\\r<br />Hah! Stupid bitch gets to take my place tonight! Bastard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to rape her senseless. I just hope he forgets about my poor ass for a while. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they could get that big, even on an incubus! He must be part horse!\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Ugh, I still can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe the bastard makes me call him \\xe2\\x80\\x98Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99 all the time. At least there are two other girls here who can take some of the attention away.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSevera, Della, you two strip as well. Pleasure eachother while I entertain my new pet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\r<br />DAMNIT! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not even into girls! I hate how my body moves to take off my clothes at his command. I hate it even more that I know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only allowed to wear those clothes because it makes me more effective in combat.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />No, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touch me there you stupid slut! Oh, god, what is my tongue doing? What is her tongue doing? OHHHH!\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />&lt;Yukiko POV&gt;\\r<br />Oh. Oh fuck. Fuck fuck fuckity FUCK! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get raped. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen, right? The two other slaves aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much help. The blonde looks like she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about to cream herself in anticipation of whatever\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen. The black-haired one just gives me a look that says, \\xe2\\x80\\x98better you than me\\xe2\\x80\\x99. What has this bastard been doing to these girls?\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I gulp as I stand there, naked, presenting myself for him. I could log out. I could escape, and make a new character. But I would lose the bonuses from reincarnating if I did that. And I would lose my only chance to find out more about Torgan.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />The black-haired girl makes a look of distaste as Master (oh god, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m even thinking about him in those terms now!) tells the two other girls to go down on eachother for entertainment while he deals with me. As he passes behind me, I feel his hands pulling at my arms that were trying to shield my body, placing them behind my head. He moves my feet shoulder width apart, and then commands me not to move, locking my body in place.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />And then I see a sign of a new debuff come up on my HUD. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Selfish Lover\\xe2\\x80\\x99? And no duration? That means it will last until canceled? What the\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">CRACK!</span> The whip sings in the air before it cracks across my butt. I moan in pleasure, though I notice a red -2 and a green +3 come up. My HP bar hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed at all. So I could literally be about to die of pain (well, pleasure for me) and I still wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to die. Sick bastard.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Another crack, another moan. And again. And again, and oh GOD, it is so good! I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take it! It feels like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to burst any moment now. But why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I cum?\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />After what seems like hours, but my HUD tells me is only twenty minutes, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m panting hard. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see straight from pleasure, but I still can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cum! And then I see that, sometime while he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been playing with me, he managed to undress. And I see the largest cock I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen outside of virtual porn.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I can see my HP drop as he slams into me. Not enough to worry about. My regen will take care of it shortly. It should hurt, but Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s figured out how to use my traits against me. I feel nothing but bliss as he pounds me, to the point where I can barely even think any more. And then, he leans forward, and whispers in my ear, <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI AM Torgan!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> Then the debuff goes away, and my mind flew away.\\r<br />\\r<br /><hr />\\r<br /><div class=\\'spoiler\\'><div class=\\'smalltext\\' style=\\'margin-bottom:2px\\'><b>Spoiler</b> : <input type=\\'button\\' value=\\'Show\\' class=\\'spoilerButton\\'></div><div class=\\'spoilerContent\\'><div style=\\'display: none;\\'>\\r<br /><div style=\"max-width: 100%;

march, so we stayed the night at the Priestess\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cabin. After a very enjoyable night (not as enjoyable for Severa, as I punished her as promised by thoroughly using her ass), and a breakfast of leftover Priestess, we set out. Incidentally, it seems that cooking skill can be used to give temporary buffs to people. The Priestess\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meat gave us a +10% movement speed for four hours, and we ate the last of her at lunch, so we got to Fathon in the midafternoon.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />As we approached the city gates, the guards started, and then bowed to the two Princesses. <span style=\"color: #669933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour Highnesses! We are so glad to see you safe! We heard what happened to your carriage. How did you escape?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Apparently, the princesses were on a diplomatic mission to human lands, when they were waylaid, the cultists used poison to overcome their escorts, and they were captured and taken to the cabin. Esyae told the guards about the Priestess, and her ritual, and how I came and stopped it. She left out some parts, like the fact that we made the Priestess into meat, but did include how I defeated that adventuring company.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />The guards turned to look at me with new eyes, and said, <span style=\"color: #669933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd who might you be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what to make of me. High Fame led to guards being friendly, but high infamy led to them disliking you. With both relatively high, at least for low levels, I was confusing them, I think.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I smiled, winningly. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am a Traveler. I first came to this world within the woods, and came upon the Priestess\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cabin by chance. Fortunately, I was in time to stop her foul deeds. Now, my companions and I have traveled long, and could do with a hot meal and good drink.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />The head guard nodded. <span style=\"color: #669933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right, then. If you follow the main road, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find the Lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Favor. Not the most expensive inn around, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got the best food, and the owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s related to the local priestess of Sharess. Next to it you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find the Adventurer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Guild. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a new Traveler as you say, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be wanting to check in there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />The Lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Favor was a typical fantasy-world type inn, though you could tell it was a fairly high end place, as it was a three story affair. There was a common room on the ground floor, which doubled as a tavern. Well the whole story is pretty clich\\xc3\\xa9, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll skip it. Needless to say, we got two rooms, with meals included, for three nights, paying a total of 10 Silver, 5 Copper for each room. The Princesses got one room, and my slaves and I were sharing the other. The three-night stay was so we could rest, train in classes and professions, and hopefully get transportation to the elvish kingdom, so we wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to walk the whole way. We probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to afford horses for all of us, but a wagon of some sort should be within our reach, right?\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Anyways, once we had checked in to our rooms, the Princesses went to see some of the people they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d met in the city, and my slaves followed me to the guild hall. This was actually a three-story building as well, which is impressive for a medieval city. Probably used magic to help?\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Entering the main room, we of course drew stares from people. It is common enough in games, especially with newcomers. When a newcomer has two pretty women following behind him, that tends to draw even more attention. Looking at the desk, I saw that a young man was there.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello there, I would like to see about registering as an adventurer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #999933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, can slaves be registered?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #999933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid not. But if the slave is a former adventurer, their ranking will help yours, and the actions of your slaves will count for completing missions. They are considered to be property, like your sword.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. I will register myself, and Severa here will need to turn in her card.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #999933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the record, how did you come to have an adventurer as your slave?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer adventuring company, the Black Hand, was working for a Priestess conducting a dark ritual. They attacked me when I interrupted the ritual. She is the only survivor of that group.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #999933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh. The Black Hand was an E ranked company. Well done, for a new adventurer!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I am a Traveler. And may I hear more about the various ranks?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\r<br />\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #999933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, well that explains it. As for the ranks, they range from F through A, and then S, SS, and SSS. Everyone undergoes tests in order to determine their ranking. Once your initial ranking has been set, you may increase your rank later through accomplishments, though you will still need to take the tests to have the rank confirmed. Used to be, there was a point system, but we found that people would cheat or outright buy their way to higher ranks, for glory or out of pride, and would wind up getting killed when they took a quest that was too advanced for them. So the current system allows for advancement, but keeps the unqualified from moving beyond their capabilities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xc2\\xa0</span>\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what do these tests entail?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #999933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA test of skills for warriors and a test of magic for mages. You can choose to do one or both tests.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what other services does the guild provide?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #999933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn addition to verifying quest difficulty and rewards, we also will buy materials and gear you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need, at a fair price based on the current market. For those who have yet to unlock their class or subclass, we have testing services that suggest paths you would be well suited to, and gives you the requirements. In addition, members of the guild may stay at the guild hall free of charge, so long as they are in good standing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to complete my registration now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #999933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease fill out this form.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I filled out the form, and the clerk said that they would have it ready by the next evening. Since the test instructors had gone home for the day, we would come back the next day for my evaluation. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the way, where might I seek training in various professions?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #999933;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tradesman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Guild down by the Marketplace is where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll want to go. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re closed for the night, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be open early tomorrow morning. If there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a profession you want to learn and there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a trainer there, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll at least tell you where to go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />I thanked the clerk, who was apparently named Bill, and left, with Severa and Della in my wake. Severa had been blushing furiously this whole time, since she used to be an E rank, and was now publicly being called a slave. Oh well, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to have to get over it, since I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t intend on letting her go anytime soon. Neither of my slaves is getting free. A slave harem that I can take with me as we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fighting? Why hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I thought of this before? Oh yeah, Torgan was a light-type, and would never do such a thing. Good thing Zayn is a corrupt bastard!\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Speaking about harems and corruption, I was eager to experience more of both, so we went back to the inn for the evening meal. Nothing overly fancy, just some meat, cheese, bread, and ale, but it was all tasty stuff. You know, that kind of simple, home-style cooking that you can get together in half an hour, but satisfies much more than the little artistic plates at a five-star restaurant.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />After dinner, we went up to our room, after bidding good night to the princesses. Once the door was closed behind us, I commanded my slaves to strip, so I could examine them more closely. This was the first time we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been alone, after all. Of course, I also removed my clothes.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Della had blond hair reaching down to her shoulders, with blue eyes, about 5\\xe2\\x80\\x996\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tall. If I had to categorize her, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d put her down as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98slender\\xe2\\x80\\x99 type. Her curves weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too noticeable, but they were just the right proportions, and went nicely with her B cups. She had this innocent look about her, a \\xe2\\x80\\x98girl next door\\xe2\\x80\\x99 type. Of course, she was also a big time S, following Loviatar. I noticed a tattoo on the small of her back, just above her butt. The girl actually had a tramp stamp with Loviatar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s symbol!\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Severa, on the other hand, was a tall, raven-haired sex machine. Or she would be, when I was done with her. 6\\xe2\\x80\\x99 even, she had curves to make men drool and women weep, which were only accentuated when she wore those leather pants she favored. Her hourglass figure was only enhanced by some nice Ds up top. Unlike Della, who had neatly trimmed her hair between her legs, Severa was shaved. Apparently, she was used to being the dominant one in a relationship, and being forced to be my plaything was an adjustment to her. Her hair was normally pulled back into a pony-tail, but was now loose, reaching down to her waist.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Looking over my beauties, I circled, pinching and prodding them as I talked, making sure to tease them as a bit of foreplay. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs you heard, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be an adventurer, and you two will be coming with me when I go into the field. We still have to get classes for myself and Della, and you two need professions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #cc6633;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought \\xe2\\x80\\x98sex slave\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was going to be our profession now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> Ah, Severa, thank you for that interruption.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSevera, bend over and grab your ankles. Della, spank Severa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bottom while I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m speaking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to train Severa into an M, and Della into a \\xe2\\x80\\x98switch\\xe2\\x80\\x99. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll work best, yeah. As the first smacks of Della\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand against Severa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rear echo through the room along with Severa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whimpers, I continue. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll both be having plenty of sex, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m an incubus after all, and so I have needs. But I want my property to be productive, as well. While I could whore you out, I thought it would be better for you both to learn something useful. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be going down to the marketplace tomorrow and see what professions are available. And, depending on price, we might even visit the slave market and find another to join our group.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #cc66ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnother, Master?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> Della spoke up, even as she continued spanking her fellow slave. Her cheeks were flushed, so I could tell she was getting excited by the situation.\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br /><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes, I intend to have a full party eventually. You and Severa will be good for healing and for stealth attacks and other such things. But we could use a true mage or a warrior that specializes in defense. That will allow us to face a wider array of enemies, and provide better safety for you all. As a Traveler, if I die, I will return after a time, but that is not true for those of you born in this world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span>\\r<br />\\xc2\\xa0\\r<br />Della nodded, signaling that she understood, and I smiled. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Della, step away from Severa.

How about a Succubus/ Lamia hybrid that charms the MC into buying her?
